This is R code designed to query the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) [API](https://docs.openalex.org/)
and retrieve institutional research outputs. It then takes those outputs and converts it to an Excel file for ease of use.

This code is inspired by the code developed by Teresa Schultz for her FSCI 2025 Workshop available here: (https://github.com/schauch/OpenAlexRFSCI2025)

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

For the basics of getting started, this [guide](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) may be helpful.

First off, you'll need to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

You'll need software to edit and run code. I recommend (and use) the free and open source [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/?sid=1).

The code should do this for you, but you'll also need install 3 packages:
[openalexR](https://github.com/ropensci/openalexR)
[tidayverse](https://tidyverse.org/)
[openxlsx2](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/)
